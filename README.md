# ðŸ§  SmartPaperQ â€” AI-Powered Research Paper Assistant

SmartPaperQ is a next-gen **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application designed to assist researchers in navigating and understanding complex research papers. Powered by **Groq's ultra-fast LLM API**, it provides accurate and contextually relevant answers to your research queries with minimal latency.

## Features

- **Intelligent Query Processing**: Understands and processes complex research questions
- **Contextual Answers**: Provides answers based on the context of the research paper
- **Ultra-Fast Inference**: Uses Groq API for lightning-fast responses (10-100x faster than typical APIs)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction
- **Multi-Document Support**: Handles multiple research papers simultaneously
- **Smart Caching**: Optional document caching for faster repeated uploads
- **Multiple Models**: Choice between Llama 3 (70B & 8B) and Mixtral models

## Why Groq?

SmartPaperQ leverages Groq's LPU (Language Processing Unit) Inference API for:
- **Ultra-low latency**: Generate answers in a fraction of the time compared to other APIs
- **High throughput**: Process more queries with less waiting
- **Cost efficiency**: Groq provides competitive pricing for LLM inference
- **Top-tier models**: Access to state-of-the-art models like Llama 3 70B and Mixtral
